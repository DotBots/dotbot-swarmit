# SwarmIT applications for the DotBots

This repositories contains samples applications that can be used on
[DotBots](https://github.com/dotbots/dotbot-firmware) robots in conjunction
with the [SwarmIT](https://github.com/dotbots/swarmit) infrastructure.

[SwarmIT](https://github.com/dotbots/swarmit) provides a lightweight
infrastructure to turn a swarm of robots in a testbed.

5 sample applications, compatible with SwarmIT, are provided to show how to
adapt DotBot-firmware code.
The sample applications are only compatible with the DotBot-v2 and DotBot-v3
targets, the only DotBot platforms powered by an nRF53 microcontroller, which
is a requirement of SwarmIT.
